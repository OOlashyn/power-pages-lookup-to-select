import PowerPagesLookupSample from '../../../components/PowerPagesLookupSample.astro';
import Select2Sample from '../../../components/Select2Sample.astro';

LtS is built as a jQuery function, so you can call **lookupToSelect()** on a selector that defines your lookup field (ideally use an id selector ie "#lookup_name"). The simplest version will require next parameters:
* **idFieldName** - id field of the table you are fetching data from (example: accountid)
* **textFieldName** - primary name field of the table you are fetching data from (example: name)
* **entitySetName** - table collection name within Web API (example: accounts). See more details on how to find it/use it in [official Power Page documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-pages/configure/web-api-overview#using-entitysetname)
* **targetTableLogicalName** - logical name of your table (example: account)

LtS will also handle population of the lookup field with the selected value, so you don't need to worry about that.

For example: to convert lookup to the Account table with id dwctst_employer we would need to execute following code:

```javascript
    $("#dwctst_employer").lookupToSelect({
        idFieldName: 'accountid',
        textFieldName: 'name',
        entitySetName: 'accounts',
        targetTableLogicalName: 'account'
    });
```

Running this code will turn this:

<PowerPagesLookupSample label="Employer"/>

Into this:

<Select2Sample label="Employer"/>
